-- Listing 3-1: Character data types in action

CREATE TABLE char_data_types (
    varchar_column varchar(10),
    char_column char(10),
    text_column text
);

INSERT INTO char_data_types
VALUES
    ('abc', 'abc', 'abc'),
    ('defghi', 'defghi', 'defghi');

-- Listing 3-2: Number data types in action

CREATE TABLE number_data_types (
    numeric_column numeric(20,5),
    real_column real,
    double_column double precision
);

INSERT INTO number_data_types
VALUES
    (.7, .7, .7),

    (2.1357987654, 2.1357987654, 2.1357987654);

SELECT * FROM number_data_types;

-- Listing 3-3: Rounding issues with float columns
-- Assumes table created and loaded with Listing 3-2

SELECT
    numeric_column * 10000000 AS "Fixed",
    real_column * 10000000 AS "Float"
FROM number_data_types
WHERE numeric_column = .7;

-- Listing 3-4: Timestamp and interval types in action

CREATE TABLE date_time_types (
    timestamp_column timestamp with time zone,
    interval_column interval
);

INSERT INTO date_time_types
VALUES
    ('2018-12-31 01:00 EST','2 days'),

    ('2018-12-31 01:00 Australia/Melbourne','1 century'),

SELECT * FROM date_time_types;

-- Listing 3-5: Using the interval data type
-- Assumes script 3-4 has been run

SELECT
    timestamp_column,
    interval_column,
    timestamp_column - interval_column AS new_date
FROM date_time_types;

-- Listing 3-6: Three CAST() examples

SELECT timestamp_column, CAST(timestamp_column AS varchar(10))
FROM date_time_types;

SELECT numeric_column,
       CAST(numeric_column AS integer),
       CAST(numeric_column AS varchar(6))
FROM number_data_types;

-- Does not work:
SELECT CAST(char_column AS integer) FROM char_data_types;

-- Alternate notation for CAST is the double-colon:
SELECT timestamp_column::varchar(10)
FROM date_time_types;

-- 1. Your company delivers fruit and vegetables to local grocery stores, and
-- you need to track the mileage driven by each driver each day to a tenth
-- of a mile. Assuming no driver would ever travel more than 999 miles in
-- a day, what would be an appropriate data type for the mileage column in your
-- table. Why?

-- Answer:

numeric(4,1)

-- numeric(4,1) provides four digits total (the precision) and one digit after
-- the decimal (the scale). That would allow you to store a value as large
-- as 999.9.

-- In practice, you may want to consider that the assumption on maximum miles
-- in a day could conceivably exceed 999.9 and go with the larger numeric(5,1).

-- 2. In the table listing each driver in your company, what are appropriate
-- data types for the driversâ€™ first and last names? Why is it a good idea to
-- separate first and last names into two columns rather than having one
-- larger name column?

-- Answer:

varchar(50)

-- 50 characters is a reasonable length for names, and varchar() ensures you
-- will not waste space when names are shorter. Separating first and last names
-- into their own columns will let you later sort on each independently.

-- 3. Assume you have a text column that includes strings formatted as dates.
-- One of the strings is written as '4//2017'. What will happen when you try
-- to convert that string to the timestamp data type?

-- Answer: Attempting to convert a string of text that does not conform to
-- accepted date/time formats will result in an error. You can see this with
-- the below example, which tries to cast the string as a timestamp.

SELECT CAST('4//2017' AS timestamp with time zone);
